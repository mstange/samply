///
///  - Relative addresses, i.e. `u32` addresses which are relative to the image base address.
///  - SVMAs, or "stated virtual memory addresses", i.e. `u64` addresses which are meaningful
///    in the virtual memory space defined by the binary file. Symbol addresess and section
///    addresses in the binary are in this space.
///  - File offsets into the binary file. These are used when you have an absolute address in
///    the virtual memory of a running process, and map it to a file offset with the help
///    of process maps, e.g. with the help of `/proc/<pid>/maps` on Linux.
///

/// a file for which all three are the same. For a file for which all three are different,
