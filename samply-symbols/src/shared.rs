///
/// Relative addresses are u32 offsets which are relative to some "base address".
///
/// This function computes that base address. It is defined as follows:
///
///  - For Windows binaries, the base address is the "image base address".
///  - For mach-O binaries, the base address is the vmaddr of the __TEXT segment.
///  - For ELF binaries, the base address is the vmaddr of the *first* segment,
///    i.e. the vmaddr of the first "LOAD" ELF command.
///
/// In many cases, this base address is simply zero:
///
///  - ELF images of dynamic libraries (i.e. not executables) usually have a
///    base address of zero.
///  - Stand-alone mach-O dylibs usually have a base address of zero because their
///    __TEXT segment is at address zero.
///  - In PDBs, "RVAs" are relative addresses which are already relative to the
///    image base.
///
/// However, in the following cases, the base address is usually non-zero:
///
///  - The "image base address" of Windows binaries is usually non-zero.
///  - mach-O executable files (not dylibs) usually have their __TEXT segment at
///    address 0x100000000.
///  - mach-O libraries in the dyld shared cache have a __TEXT segment at some
///    non-zero address in the cache.
///  - ELF executables can have non-zero base addresses, e.g. 0x200000 or 0x400000.
///  - Kernel ELF binaries ("vmlinux") have a large base address such as
///    0xffffffff81000000. Moreover, the base address seems to coincide with the
///    vmaddr of the .text section, which is readily-available in perf.data files
